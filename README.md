# JeLLyFysh

The JeLLyFysh Python application implements the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm (ECMC), an event-driven irreversible 
Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm for classical *N*-body simulations in statistical mechanics, biophysics and 
electrochemistry. The application's architecture closely mirrors the mathematical formulation of ECMC. For a detailed 
description of the design of this application, see [\[Hoellmer2019\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12502). For a closely 
connected discussion of ECMC, see [\[Faulkner2018\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05795). (See the 
[References.bib](References.bib) file.)

## Installing

The JeLLyFysh Python application can be executed with any Python implementation which supports Python version >= 3.5. It 
is tested with cPython and [PyPy](http://pypy.org) version >= 7. A limited amount of modules depends on non standard 
library Python packages. Take a look at our [external dependencies](EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES.md) to see which parts of 
JeLLyFysh can only be used after additional packages have been installed.

JeLLyFysh is readily installed just by cloning this repository.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, simply enter the [`unittests`](unittests) directory and run [`run_tests.py`](unittests/run_tests.py) 
with your Python implementation. These tests may take a while.

## Using JeLLyFysh

The user interface for each run of the JeLLyFysh application consists in a configuration file that is an argument of the 
[`run.py`](src/run.py) script, which is located in the [`src`](src) directory. Configuration files should follow the 
[INI-file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).

The `run.py` script expects the path to the configuration file as the first positional argument. The script also takes 
optional arguments. These are:
- `-h`, `--help`: Show the help message and exit.
- `-V`, `--version`: Show program's version number and exit.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Increase verbosity of logging messages (multiple -v options increase the verbosity, the maximum is 
2).
- `-l LOGFILE`, `--logfile LOGFILE`: Specify the logging file. 

A configuration file is composed of sections that each correspond to a class of the JeLLyFysh application. The only
required section for the run script is

```INI
[Run]
mediator = some_mediator
setting = some_setting
```

`some_mediator` corresponds the the used mediator in the run. The mediator serves as a central hub in the application 
and also hosts the iteration loop over the legs of the continuous-time evolution of ECMC. The two possible mediators are
[`single_process_mediator`](src/mediator/single_process_mediator.py), which runs the application in a single process, 
and [`multi_process_mediator`](src/mediator/multi_process_mediator/multi_process_mediator.py), which calculates the 
events of ECMC in separate processes. Both are located in the [`src/mediator`](src/mediator) package. Currently we 
recommend the single-process version.

`setting` specifies the *NVT* physical parameters of the run. The two possible settings are 
[`hypercubic_setting`](src/setting/hypercubic_setting.py) and 
[`hypercuboid_setting`](src/setting/hypercuboid_setting.py) (both located in the [`src/setting`](src/setting) package).

The following sections of the configuration file choose the parameters in the `__init__` methods of the mediator and the 
setting. Each section contains pairs of properties and values. The property corresponds to the name of the argument in 
the `__init__` method of the given class, and its value provides the arguments. Properties and values should be given in 
snake_case, sections in CamelCase. For a detailed description of the JeLLyFysh factory, which parses the configuration 
file and constructs the specified classes, see [here](FACTORY.md). There, also a detailed example for the interplay
between the factory and a configuration file is given. All classes of JeLLyFysh are documented with docstrings to 
clarify their usage. For a general overview of the parts of JeLLyFysh, see 
[\[Hoellmer2019\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12502).

Some example configuration files are located in the 
[`src/config_files/2018_JCP_149_064113`](src/config_files/2018_JCP_149_064113) directory. They are described in detail in
the "Cookbook" section (Section 5) of [\[Hoellmer2019\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12502). They 
generate output in the [`src/output/2018_JCP_149_064113`](src/output/2018_JCP_149_064113) directory.

Instances of the event-handler classes in the JeLLyFysh application compute candidate events. Hints on how to implement 
your own event handlers are given [here](HOWTO_EVENT_HANDLER.md) (see [\[Hoellmer2019\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12502)
for details).

## Contributing

## Versioning

Versioning of the JeLLyFysh project adopts two-to-four-field version numbers defined as Milestone.Feature.AddOn.Patch. 
The current version 1.0 represents the first development milestone which reproduces published data in 
[\[Faulkner2018\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05795). Patches and bugfixes of this version will be given number 1.0.0.1, 
1.0.0.2 etc. New configuration files and required extensions are expected to lead to versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2 etc. In 
JeLLyFysh development, two-field versions (2.0, 3.0, etc.) may introduce incompatible code, while three- and four-field 
version numbers are intended to be backward compatible.
